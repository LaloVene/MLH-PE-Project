# DevUp
By Michelle Shen, Eduardo Venegas, and Angela Wang

## Project Overview
DevUp is a platform where developers of all skill levels can find other developers to team up with on a project. Developers can search for projects that they are interested in, and contact the current team members of the project to learn more about them and join their team. Developers that already have an project idea can make a post on DevUp to display it to other seeking developers and find new team members.
